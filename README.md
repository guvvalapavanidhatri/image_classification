PROJECT DESCRIPTION

This project focuses on building an image classification model using TensorFlow and Keras, two powerful tools in the field of deep learning. The goal is to automatically categorize images into predefined classes by training a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) on a labeled dataset.

Using a dataset such as CIFAR-10, MNIST, or custom images, the model learns to extract visual features and make predictions. The project involves data preprocessing, model building, training, validation, and testing. Techniques like data augmentation, dropout, and optimization algorithms (like Adam) are used to improve accuracy and prevent overfitting.

The final model is evaluated using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and confusion matrix. It can be deployed for real-time image classification tasks in various applications such as medical imaging, facial recognition, and object detection.

Technologies Used:

Python

TensorFlow

Keras

NumPy, Matplotlib, and Pandas for data handling and visualization
